# Text Classification Model README

## Overview

This repository contains a text classification model built using Python and scikit-learn. The model uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to classify text data into predefined categories or classes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Training and test data in CSV format. Ensure you have the data files available.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd text-classification-model
   ```

2. Install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your training data in CSV format in the `/data` directory with the following structure:

   ```
   /data
   ├── train.csv
   └── test.csv
   ```

4. Open the Python script `text_classification.py` and review/configure the following parameters:

   - File paths for training and test data.
   - Hyperparameters for the TF-IDF vectorizer and the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

5. Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions on the test data:
   ```
   python text_classification.py
   ```

6. The model will output the accuracy score on the validation set and generate a `test_predictions.csv` file containing the test data with predicted class labels.

## Evaluation

The performance of the text classification model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the classification report. Consider the context of your problem and domain-specific requirements to determine if the model's performance is satisfactory.
